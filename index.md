# Sunscreen Reminder Hat with UV Detector
This project reminds you to reapply sunscreen with a wearable circuit and UV index sensor all sown into a hat. The UV/visible light sensor detects if you are outside by seeing if the UV Index is greater than the set threshold. When someone is under direct sunlight, the sensor tells the mainboard that the threshold was crossed, to which the mainboard tells the buzzer to beep.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was soldering my UV sensor, buzzer, and battery connector to the mainboard. This made all my connections permanent and enabled all of them to work together. After they were all joined, I needed a separate code to have them all interact with each other. Once I found this code, I tweaked the reapply intervals to suit my needs. Some issues I fixed were the UV sensor not working because of the excess solder on the bottom of the sensor. I learned how to properly apply solder and clean it up to minimize residue.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was getting my UV/Visible light sensor to display UV, visible light, and IR levels to the serial monitor. I was able to do this by connecting my UV sensor to the mainboard(Adafruit Flora) and then inputting code that told the sensor to display its results to the serial monitor. I was also able to separately get my buzzer to play the Super Mario theme. I was able to do this by connecting my buzzer to the same mainboard and inputting code that had the tune and time intervals for the song.
